  The Run-2 data set is awesome! And both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations are working to make the most of it by creating innovative analyses to learn from the data set. However, these analyses should not disappear when the people who wrote the code move on. Luckily, throughout the course of Run 2, a number of tools have permeated HEP computing culture that can be used to help ensure that analyses are preserved in a robust way, thereby facilitating the reproduction of our own results. This joint bootcamp with members from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations aims to introduce analyzers who are already proficient in basic analysis tools and concepts (e.g. C++, Python, event selection, limit setting) to the next level of robust analysis. This includes CI/CD, Dockerization, REANA/Yadage workflows, and more tools that are used throughout all corners of industry.
